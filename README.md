## Website Attempt

I'm gonna try to make my own website...

Notes to myself:
 - purchasing a domain :thonk:
 - change the repo name before publishing x.x
 - ... do stuff... yeah

If the jeckyll thing is there do I still need style.css? No apparently.
https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal details on the minimal style here
(good resource for reference https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal/blob/master/index.md -> Code view)

Current site: https://vereimyst.github.io/Oooh-sparkly-/ how to change left side?

Also there are contributors in this thing... do I keep them? can I even not keep them? idk man
