<h1>
  Hello there!
</h1>

<html>
  <body>
    My name is Someone Someone. I'm figuring out how to make my own website I swear and I still don't know how to upload files 
    to this webpage. I think I have an idea of how, but I'm not sure if it works since I haven't tested it.
  <br>
    Some notes for myself in the meantime...
  <br>
  <br>
    That's a line break.
  <br>
    An unordered list goes like so:
    <ul>
      <li> some website </li>
      <li> <a href="https://github.com"> This is a link to GitHub! </a> </li>
    </ul>
  <br>
    Don't forget closing statements go like `</something>`
  <br>
    The layout thing is complicated... I'll look at it eventually. Apparently if I change this from "index.html" to literally anything, 
    it doesn't work anymore and the ReadMe gets put on the page instead... great.
  <br>
    Remember that website URL? Might wanna change it to something of substance some day.
